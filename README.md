# Agro-Facilitation
A feather based web application that minimizes the farmers' loss through preventable remedies .

Introduction
India is a country of farmers and orchards.

Indian agriculture sector accounts for 18 per cent of India's GDP and provides employment to 50% of the country’s workforce.

India is the world’s largest producer of pulses, rice, wheat, spices, sugarcane and spice products.

India is an agriculture based country, where more than 50% of population is dependent on agriculture. This structures the main source of income.

It is said that agriculture in India is a backbone for Indian Economy.
